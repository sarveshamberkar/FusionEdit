# FusionEdit
FusionEdit is an advanced image editing tool that integrates powerful segmentation and diffusion technologies to provide users with intuitive and high-quality image enhancement capabilities. The project leverages the Segment Anything model for precise point input segmentation and Stable Diffusion for creative image editing. One of the standout features of FusionEdit is Auto-Enhance, which utilizes super resolution to automatically improve image quality.
## Features Overview
 - [ ] Segment Anything Integration: Point-based segmentation for precise area selection.

- [ ] Stable Diffusion Editing: Artistic and creative image editing through diffusion models.

- [ ] Auto-Enhance: Automatic image quality improvement using super resolution.**(Future Scope)**

## Features
* Segment Anything Integration: Use point-based segmentation to identify and edit specific areas of an image.
* Stable Diffusion Editing: Apply artistic and creative edits through diffusion models.
* Auto-Enhance: Automatically improve image resolution and quality using super resolution techniques.**(Future Scope)**

## Technologies Used
1. Segment Anything: Provides segmentation capabilities through point input, allowing precise and flexible selection of image areas.
2. Stable Diffusion(Image Impainting): Utilized for advanced, artistic editing and transformation of images.
3. Super Resolution: Enhances image resolution and quality in the Auto-Enhance feature, improving clarity and detail.**(Future Scope)**

## Auto-Enhance Feature **(Future Scope)**
The Auto-Enhance feature aims to automatically improve the quality of images using super resolution. This process involves the following steps:
1. Input Image: The user provides an image to be enhanced.
2. Preprocessing: The image is preprocessed to prepare it for super resolution. This may include resizing or normalization.
3. Super Resolution Model: The preprocessed image is passed through a super resolution model to upscale and enhance image details.
4. Postprocessing: The output from the super resolution model is refined and adjusted for final quality.
5. Display Result: The enhanced image is presented to the user, showcasing improved resolution and detail.
